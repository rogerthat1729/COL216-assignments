# Cache Simulator - COL216

## Parameters to judge the cache effectiveness:
- total cache size
- hit rate
- miss rate
- hardware costs (comparators)

## Factors affecting the parameters:
- n-way associativity
- block size
- replacement policy
- write-through or write-back
- write-allocate - yes or no

## Hit rate and miss rate 
We will first optimise the miss rate based on the associativity.
